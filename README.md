# React Sagas Fruit Basket
This was my first project working with React Redux Sagas. For the project, I created a Sagas to POST, GET, and DELETE fruit from the fruit basket. I also added CSS styling to make it look less vanilla.

## Installation
* `npm install`
* In separate Terminal tabs `npm run client` and `npm run server`
* Because we're using `nodemon`, both our client side and server side will automatically spin back up when changes are made

## Technologies Used
React Gallery used the following technologies: React, React-Redux, Redux-Sags, Node.js, Express.js, and CSS for styling.

## Acknowledgement
I'd like to thank Prime Digital Academy and my classmates in the Porta cohort for their help and support with this project.
